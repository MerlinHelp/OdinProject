            <li> Cut the pork belly into thin pieces (~1/4 inch thick). 
                <br>&emsp;Marinate the pork belly with 2 tsp of fish sauce, 2 tsp of sugar, 
                <br>&emsp;1/4 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of pepper, 1/4 tsp of paprika,

        <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Make the broth</h4>
        <ol style="margin-top:10px;">
            <li> Heat oil over medium high heat in a large soup pot. 
                <br>&emsp;Saute shrimp with half of the minced shallots and garlic. 
                <br>&emsp;Remove and set aside. In the same pot, saute the pork belly with the remaining shallots and garlic. Set aside.</li>
            <li> In the same pot, saute the shrimp heads. Squeeze out the head juice while sauteing.
                <br>&emsp;Add 4 cans of chicken broth and the yellow onion and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Finish the broth and assemble your bowl</h4>
        <ol style="margin-top:10px">
            <li> While the soup is simmering, prep the rest of your ingredients.
                <br>&emsp;Boil the noodles and quail eggs. Shred up the cabbage.
                <br>&emsp;Toast and crush your peanuts. Microwave the black sesame crackers for 3 minutes to puff them up.</li>

                <br>&emsp;Add the pork belly back to the pot and simmer for 5 more minutes.
                <br>&emsp;Once the soup is done, taste for seasoning and add more salt if it tastes bland.</li>
            <li> Now it's time to assemble your bowl! Add turmeric noodles to the bowl.
                <br>&emsp;Follow with the mint, Vietnamese coriander, bean sprouts, shredded cabbage, shrimp and quail eggs.
